# Apex Command Center — Build Progress

**Last updated:** 2026-06-30 (session 3)
**Current phase:** Phase 1 — manual transcript intake
**Last session summary:** Fixed "pdf_data ausente" bug on Gerar PDF button. Root cause was a two-part mismatch: (1) Worker SELECT omitted the pdf_data column so it never reached the frontend, and (2) frontend was looking for pdf_data nested inside summary_json instead of reading the top-level pdf_data column. Both fixed, committed, pushed, and deployed (wrangler deploy confirmed, version 1e869289).

## ==========================================================================
## CRITICAL — READ BEFORE TOUCHING Gerar PDF / pdf_data IN FUTURE SESSIONS
## ==========================================================================
## pdf_data lives in its OWN TOP-LEVEL COLUMN on the sessions table (added
## manually via D1 console with ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN pdf_data TEXT).
## It is NOT nested inside summary_json. Any code that reads summary_json and
## then accesses .pdf_data from it will ALWAYS fail.
##
## Worker (worker/index.js): handleGetSessions SELECT must include pdf_data.
## Frontend (dashboard.html): handleGeneratePdf reads session.pdf_data directly
##   with JSON.parse(session.pdf_data) — never goes through summary_json.
##
## Test session: "Test 3", id 740c0efd-d19b-49aa-9866-cdafce1dd0f5 — has
## valid pdf_data inserted directly in D1. Use it to confirm PDF generation.
## ==========================================================================

## In Progress
- [ ] Switching /api/transcript from Granola API to manual paste
  - Status: complete — needs deploy + end-to-end test
  - Files touched: worker/index.js, dashboard.html

## Up Next
- [ ] Test manual transcript → summarize → approve flow end to end
- [ ] Build session detail screen
- [ ] PDF generation/approval flow
- [ ] Add templates/ folder with PDF template + JSON
- [ ] Fix logo in PDF template (manual edit, not AI)
- [ ] Add page 8 to PDF template (Claude Design session)
- [ ] Rafa's view content (nav tab exists, content empty)
- [ ] Build clients.html, client.html, session.html, documents.html, tasks.html, rafa.html, dev.html

## Decisions Made This Session
- Phase 1 uses manual transcript paste only — Granola API integration deferred to Phase 1.5 (only 25 free meetings before Granola requires upgrade)
- Keeping /api/transcript as the same endpoint, just changing its expected body — no new route created

## Known Issues / Blockers
- PDF template logo is a recreated SVG, not the real Apex logo — needs manual fix in template HTML
- PDF template missing page 8 (back cover) — needs Claude Design session
- Alice's real email was wrong in early docs — corrected to Alicecorsino12@gmail.com

## Files Created / Modified This Session
- worker/index.js — removed Granola API call from handlePostTranscript; now accepts { client_name, transcript, date }
- dashboard.html — replaced Granola ID input with client name + date + transcript textarea; updated handlePullTranscript() to match new body shape
- progress.md — created this file
