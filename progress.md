## In Progress
- [ ] Switching /api/transcript from Granola API to manual paste
  - Status: complete — needs deploy + end-to-end test
  - Files touched: worker/index.js, dashboard.html

## Up Next
- [ ] Test manual transcript → summarize → approve flow end to end
- [ ] Build session detail screen
- [ ] PDF generation/approval flow
- [ ] Add templates/ folder with PDF template + JSON
- [ ] Fix logo in PDF template (manual edit, not AI)
- [ ] Add page 8 to PDF template (Claude Design session)
- [ ] Rafa's view content (nav tab exists, content empty)
- [ ] Build clients.html, client.html, session.html, documents.html, tasks.html, rafa.html, dev.html

## Decisions Made This Session
- Phase 1 uses manual transcript paste only — Granola API integration deferred to Phase 1.5 (only 25 free meetings before Granola requires upgrade)
- Keeping /api/transcript as the same endpoint, just changing its expected body — no new route created

## Known Issues / Blockers
- PDF template logo is a recreated SVG, not the real Apex logo — needs manual fix in template HTML
- PDF template missing page 8 (back cover) — needs Claude Design session
- Alice's real email was wrong in early docs — corrected to Alicecorsino12@gmail.com

## Files Created / Modified This Session
- worker/index.js — removed Granola API call from handlePostTranscript; now accepts { client_name, transcript, date }
- dashboard.html — replaced Granola ID input with client name + date + transcript textarea; updated handlePullTranscript() to match new body shape
- progress.md — created this file
